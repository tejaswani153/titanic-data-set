This repository contains a Python project for analyzing the Titanic dataset.
Key features:

Data Cleaning – Handles missing values, drops irrelevant columns, and standardizes data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Calculates survival rates by gender, passenger class, and age groups.

Visualizations – Creates bar charts and histograms to reveal key patterns in survival rates.

Interactive CSV Loader – Allows selecting the Titanic CSV file from your system.

Flexible Column Handling – Automatically adapts to datasets with different column names.

Technologies used:

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

Tkinter (Interactive file selection)

Goal: To practice data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques while exploring one of the most famous datasets in data science.
